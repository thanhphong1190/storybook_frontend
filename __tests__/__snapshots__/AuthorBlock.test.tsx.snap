      My first contact with Plus Fitness 24/7 was as a long time member of their health clubs, which have been around for many years and were well known in the Macarthur region. 
      I have spent my career in business banking and was fortunate enough to have Plus Fitness 24/7 as a client when they made the decision to develop the brand as a franchise. 
      It was very exciting seeing the process and watch the company sell it's first franchise,
      and before I knew it they had sold their 50th and so on. I had a relationship with some of the early franchisees and they had such great things to say about their experiences, 
      I developed a keen interest in the model and contemplated jumping ship many times from business banker to business owner.",
